Based on all of the above, produce a structured SOC triage report with exactly these four sections:

**1. THREAT CLASSIFICATION**
Classify the threat type, attack vector, potential impact, and whether this is likely a true positive or false positive. Note any indicators of compromise (IoCs). Be specific about what this event represents in the context of real-world attack patterns.

**2. RECOMMENDED ACTION**
Provide a clear, prioritized list of concrete next steps for the SOC team. Include immediate containment actions, investigation steps, and any escalation paths. Reference the human analyst verdict.

**3. URGENCY SCORE**
Provide a single integer urgency score from 1 to 10 (10 = most urgent) with a brief justification. Format it as: `URGENCY: X/10 — <justification>`

**4. ANALYST SUMMARY**
A concise 2-3 sentence executive summary suitable for a shift handoff or management briefing. Focus on the "so what" — what happened, why it matters, and what the team is doing about it.

Be direct, precise, and actionable. Avoid generic security advice — tailor every point to this specific alert.
